\aboutme{
I am Currently Enrolled in a Mathematics and Computer Science MSci course at Queen's University Belfast. I enjoy programming and have done so as a student, an employee and a hobbyist.
 My professional experience is with C\#, but I have experience with Python, c++ and Java from University and my own studies.

I am interested in a roll as a Software Developer as it brings me great satisfaction writing good code,
which will provide a useful service to customers.

\section{Work Experience}
From September 2020 to September 2021 I completed a Placement year with Analog Devices International in Limerick, working for the Customer Facing Technology Team. My work mostly consisted of making improvements to the ACE software using C\#. This experience was very valuable to my development as a professional and a software developer, as it allowed me to work in a global team with a diverse range of experiences and backgrounds. The team I was in used Agile development techniques, assisted by Jira and BitBucket.
The agile nature of the team ment that I was often in contact with the end users of the software I was working on, and felt free to communicate to my colleagues in order to enhance collaboration.

Throughout the year I had experience working with the SciChart and Telerik WPF libraries. 
\section{Portfolio}
In February 2021 I made a simple Space Invaders like Game called ``Cannon Shooter'', which you can play here: \href{https://johnmckane.github.io/CannonShooter/htmlBuild/index.html}{Play}. The game was made using C\# and the Unity Game Engine. I consider it to be a major improvement to my previous effort called ``Puzzle Game'', as it took less time to produce and is more enjoyable.
I made Puzzle Game in the summer of 2019 using Java and LibGDX. I consider it to be a valuable learning experience as it gave me exposure to learning how to use a large open-source library to produce a product.
You can download Puzzle Game here: \href{https://johnmckane.github.io/PuzzleGame/index.html}{Download}.
Both these projects gave me experience taking a project from conception to completion.

\section{Programming and IT Skills}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
I have one year's expereince as a professional software developer and I am currently studying Mathematics and Computer Science MSCi at Queen's. I also do some programming as a hobbyist.
This has given me experience with:
\begin{itemize}
\item C\#: I used C\# with the Microsoft .Net framework for twelve months whilst working for Analog Devices International. This gave me experience working with proprietery libraries such as Telerik and SciChart, as well as working with the NUnit testing framework. I have also completed a personal project called Cannon Shooter using C\# and Unity.
\item Source Control and Git: During my placement year I used Git ,along with BitBucket, for source control. This taught me more about the 3rd party GUIs for Git such as Tortoise Git and Source Tree. A very valuable feature I learned about in my placement year was the Pull Request, and I got plenty of experience submitting them, and some experience reviewing them. During the year I also got more experience with Gits command line interface. Before my placement year I was using git form personal and university projects.
\item Python: Throughout the Mathematics side of my course at Queen's I have used Python along with the NumPy and PyChart Libraries in order to analyse data, compute solutions to equations and display the results.
This has taught me how to translate mathematical concepts into runnable computer code. During my placement year I used python to automate refactoring tasks.
\item Unix Shell: I am familiar with the Unix shell and use it regularly for various tasks. I like the Unix design philosophy of making simple, but powerful, programmes which ``Do one thing and do it well''.
\item \LaTeX: Through my mathematics course I have learned how to use \LaTeX \space  to make proffessional looking documents efficiently.
  \end{itemize}
